# 📱 PixelartUI React Native

PixelartUI React Native is the upcoming mobile implementation of the PixelartUI design system, bringing the signature pixel-art aesthetic to iOS and Android apps.  
While still in development, this version aims to extend the same design language used across the ecosystem into React Native’s mobile-first environment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the React Native Package

The goal of PixelartUI React Native is to provide a **native-feeling**, pixel-perfect component library built specifically for mobile devices, while staying true to:

-   The global PixelartUI visual identity
-   Cross-framework API consistency
-   Strong typing and predictable props
-   Retro-inspired UI patterns adapted to touch interfaces

This will allow developers to build mobile apps with the same expressive pixel-art style used on the web.

## 🧱 Design & Architecture Philosophy

### **1. Mobile-Native Interaction Patterns**

React Native components will follow native mobile conventions, including:

-   Touchable interactions
-   Native gesture behavior
-   Mobile-appropriate spacing, sizing, and hit areas

All while maintaining the crisp pixel-art look.

---

### **2. PixelartUI Styling, Mobile Adaptation**

The React Native version follows the same design rules as the main PixelartUI system:

-   Pixel grid alignment
-   Retro-styled borders and surfaces
-   Themeable color and style variants
-   Defined component visual states

But adapted for mobile, ensuring accessibility, readability, and finger-friendly controls.

---

### **3. Consistent Cross-Framework API**

Although each platform has unique technical requirements, the **props, naming, and component structure** will remain as consistent as possible with:

-   PixelartUI React (the reference implementation)
-   Future Vue, Svelte, and Web Component versions

This ensures that knowledge transfers easily across frameworks.

---

### **4. React Native–First Architecture**

Components will be built using core React Native primitives:

-   `View`
-   `Text`
-   `TouchableOpacity`
-   `Pressable`
-   `Image`

No web polyfills — a true mobile implementation.

## 🔍 What This Section Covers

Since the React Native package is **in active development**, this section focuses on:

-   The vision and architecture of PixelartUI for mobile
-   Planned component categories
-   The design principles that will guide development
-   Notes on API consistency with the web version
-   How mobile interaction differs from the desktop/web design

Full component documentation will be added once the library reaches beta.

## 🚧 Current Development Status

PixelartUI React Native is currently:

-   **🧩 In active development**
-   Implementing core components such as **Buttons, Inputs, Modals, Switches, and Boxes**
-   Building a consistent pixel-style rendering system for React Native
-   Establishing shared style tokens and component variants
-   Preparing for a public preview release

## 🌟 Bringing Pixel Art to Native Mobile Apps

The React Native implementation will allow developers to:

-   Build mobile UIs with nostalgic pixel-art aesthetics
-   Maintain consistency with PixelartUI web projects
-   Share component knowledge across platforms
-   Create playful, expressive mobile interfaces with minimal effort

PixelartUI React Native is designed to bring the same charm and creative freedom found in the React version — optimized for the mobile world.

More details and API documentation will be available as development progresses.
