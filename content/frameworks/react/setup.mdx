# Getting started

## Installation

Run the following code

```zsh copy
    npm install pixelartui-react
```

## Peer dependencies

Please make sure to install these dependencies in order for the component to be working properly

```json copy
    "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^19.1.0",
       "react-dom": "^19.1.0"
    }
```

## Default font

Pixelartui uses [Pixelify Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pixelify+Sans) for our default font. So we recommend it to be installed via [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)

```zsh copy
    npm install @fontsource/pixelify-sans
```

then you can import them first thing in your app

```zsh copy
    import  '@fontsource/pixelify-sans';
```
