# 🎨 PixelartUI

**Pixel-perfect UI components for modern web frameworks.**

PixelartUI is a **framework-agnostic design system** and component library built around a **retro pixel-art aesthetic** — crisp edges, limited palettes, and nostalgic charm — reimagined with **modern web technologies**.

## ✨ What is PixelartUI?

PixelartUI is an open-source design system and UI library crafted to bring the **look and feel of pixel art** into modern web development.

Whether you’re building a retro game dashboard, a creative tool, or a stylized website, PixelartUI gives you the building blocks to create **consistent, expressive, and responsive UIs**.

The ecosystem is designed to be **framework-independent**, with first-class support rolling out across:

-   **React** (available now)
-   **React Native**, **Vue** and **Svelte**(coming soon)
-   **Native Web Components** (planned for future releases)

## 🧱 Core Principles

### 🎮 Pixel-Art First

All components are designed on a pixel grid, using sharp edges, clean borders, and blocky typefaces for authentic retro style.

### ⚡ Modern Stack

Built using today’s best practices — fully typed, tree-shakeable, and optimized for performance.

### 🎨 Themeable (Future release)

PixelartUI includes a robust theming system that lets you customize colors, borders, and fonts while preserving the pixel style.

### 🧩 Consistent API Across Frameworks

Each framework version follows a shared design and API philosophy, making it easy to switch or share knowledge between environments.

### 🤝 Open & Extensible

Developers can extend components, contribute new ones, or adapt the system for unique use cases.
